I would like to compare the top 50 hit charts of most of the Europe countries from pre-corona and now (2019 and 2021/2022). The links to the specific Spotify playlist will follow. 

I am interested to see how music taste changed over the pandemic. Additionally, there could be a prediction to recommend specific genres to listeners in times of high stressed problems (pandemic).

This line is from R!
